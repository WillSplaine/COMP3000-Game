## Project Description 

For gamers that enjoy movement based games but want a more competitive game that ranks its players based on the skill and speed at which they can finish each level. Spark is a parkour time-trial game that employs the use of an energy consumption economy to allow players to move and eliminate enemies. Depending on the time taken to complete each level the player will be ranked and be placed on a leaderboard for all players to compete to be the best. 

Spark will force players to try to improve their efficiency at completing the levels in the fastest time. This will make players think about the optimal way to navigate the map and how best to use the energy reserves they are allotted/obtaining. In Spark there will be enemy NPCs that will have to be eliminated to progress through the levels. To eliminate the NPCs a weapon will be used that takes up a predetermined amount of the energy the player has, this will make the decisions on how to spend the economy of energy more difficult adding to the gameâ€™s skill ceiling. 

## Project Goal 
The (MVP) Minimum Viable Product for the project will allow the player to access two maps - the tutorial map for players to learn the controls and practice, and another map that is fully functional for actual playthrough. The first map should contain a target practice range for the player to get accustomed with the weapons system this game employs, an assault course with a variety of different obstacles
 to practise using some of the abilities and learn the movement mechanics and access to the weapon the player will use. The game will support the use of keyboard and mouse for the movement and controls as the game is being developed for PC players. In addition, for this to be a successful game the enemy for this game should contain behaviour for moving across the map and when within the players range, the enemy should try to interfere. Another requirement is that the player should be able to see their current runtime visually to promote a competitive atmosphere within the game. 

The MVP should be considered a good representation of the time trial genre. This includes creating obstacles that give the player a choice on how to proceed through the map in unique methods. 

For the project to be considered a (MAP) Minimum Awesome Product, the game must contain all the features from the MVP category, with the addition of a secondary map that is complete and is playable, music and sound effects that are appropriate to the game and additional features that a player may want such as being able to change the resolution of the window. In addition, to achieve MAP the skill ceiling of the game should be heightened to encourage the player to learn when and how to traverse the maps to improve.
